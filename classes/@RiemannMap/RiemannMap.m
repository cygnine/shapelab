% RiemannMap -- A map taking one domain to another in the complex plane
%
% obj = RiemannMa()
%     A functional object representing a map from one simply connected region
%     in the complex plane to another. This is map that satisfies the Riemann
%     Mapping Theorem. This class is a superclass and acts as a syntactic
%     placeholder only, has no real comptuational value, and the constructor is
%     not meant to be an end-user tool.
