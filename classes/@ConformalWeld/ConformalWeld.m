    % self = ConformalWeld()
    %     A functional object representing a conformal welding map. Let S be a
    %     simply connected region in the complex plane. There is a map taking S to
    %     the interior of the unit disc D. Similarly, there is a map taking the
    %     complement of S (in C) to the exterior of the disc. The conformal weld
    %     is then the self-map of the boundary of the unit disc that takes points
    %     from e.g. the 'interior' of dD to the 'exterior' of dD.
