  % self = ConformalMap()
  %     A functional object representing a map from one simply connected region
  %     in the complex plane to another. This is a map that satisfies the
  %     Riemann Mapping Theorem. This class is a superclass and acts as a
  %     syntactic placeholder only; it has no real comptuational value, and the
  %     constructor is not meant to be an end-user tool.
